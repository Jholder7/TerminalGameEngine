## Project Statement

I worked on this project for about two years, though I have remade it multiple times. My goal is to finalize this engine into a fully functional game engine. My goal is to keep the frontend as easy to use a possible while not limiting the freedom of complexities if one wishes to interface with them. This project holds as history and hopefully a finalized product of a fun simple ASCII game engine. Through my inevitable fuck ups and spelling, I hope this project becomes usable and an entertaining medium for game creation. 

### Simple Game Example
```scala
// This file will be updated at engine in completed.

import TermGame.*;

public class ExampleUseTemplate{

	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		Window gameWindow = Window.createWindow("Test Title", 50, 50);
		
	}

}
```
