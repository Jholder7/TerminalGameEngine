## Project Statment

I worked on this project for about two years, though I have remade it multiple times. My goal is to finalize this engine into a fully functional game engine. My goal is to keep the frontend as easy to use a possible while not limiting the freedom of complexities if one wishes to interface with them. This project holds as history and hopefully a finalized product of a fun simple ASCII game engine. Through my inevitable fuck ups and spelling, I hope this project becomes usable and an entertaining medium for game creation. 

### Simple Game Example
```scala
public class ExampleProgram{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("test");
	}
}
```
